# CSCD-349-Team-Final-2020

This was the first 3 person group project I did in a coding class to simulate what it was like for a group of coders to work together. The project instructions were simple in that we had to build some kind of game using the design patterns we had learned in class. It was a 2D text adventure game where you were supposed to be able to build your own character, explore a dungeon and fight monsters while finding potions and traps along the way and eventually finding the exit.
